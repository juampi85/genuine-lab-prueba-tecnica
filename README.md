# Technical Interview for Genuine Digital School

## 1. Which tools and technologies did you use for the project? Why?

I only used HTML and vanilla CSS.
Because I've been programming mostly in React for a while, using different frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, etc and I thought it was a good opportunity to go back to basics.

## 2. Which were the main challenges in the process? How did you solve it?

Well, I really liked the test because it had many elements at different levels of structure, so to speak.
Images inside containers that are inside other containers, and so on. That and centering all the elements...sounds like a joke, but it's not....
Also working with Figma, I liked it and it was quite difficult... 50% y 50%.
I solved it by testing, looking for different ways to simplify the solution and reviewing functions on the web.

## 3. Do you have any suggestion to the design?

The truth is that I found the design very nice (the little that can be seen, since I only have access to the static photo and not to its operation).
But the colors, contrasts, etc. seemed very appropriate.

## 4. If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
That's a very interesting question; let's see, I think I would put all the structures together first, making sure to arrange the containers, and then I would put the images and finish the final details to everything.

## 5. Did you learn anything new?
Undoubtedly, especially the deepening of Figma's functionalities.
How to export images, how to copy formats to achieve greater accuracy when replicating the web, etc...

## 6. Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities eeectively?
Yes, yes, it allows you to see a part of my layout skills.


## 7. Are there any signiÔ¨Åcant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
Yes, since I am a Full Stack programmer, so I also handle programming logic with Javascript (I also use React and Next) and server management using Node and Express and databases, using PostgreSQL and Sequelize.
